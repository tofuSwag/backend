PLAN
- Crowd Source list of Organisations; Filter it through a "process" 
using "volunteers" which will be incentivized using certificates. Will make an "Overview" dashboard.

- Change.org links

- NOT doing giveindia.org for a focus on directly noticeable problems i.e. 
a person in Noida wouldn't know problems of rural Rajasthan, but he/she would know problems 
caused by plastic, pollution and notices/faces them in daily life i.e. has a personal connect.

- db backup and limited queries to NewsAPI

- Bonus: Analytics middleware
- Future stuff:
    - Videos/other media
    - Volunteer program
